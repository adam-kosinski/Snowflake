Snowflake Generator:

By: Adam Kosinski and Cindy Zhu

This snowflake generator generates a random snowflake that has a color gradient.
We worked on the code together in several sessions and also edited outside of those. During
our meetings, we mainly split up the project and discussed ideas. We spent a lot of time researching
ways to generate a snowflake, discussing how to iterate through the hexagonal grid when generating,
and figuring out how to do melting/freezing logic. Adam worked on making the hexagonal grid, iterating through the snowflake, animation and coloring the
snowflake. Cindy worked on the logic to figure out what state (freezing/melting) a cell should change
to based on its neighbors.
